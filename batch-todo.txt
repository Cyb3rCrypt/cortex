TODO

- secure batch endpoints??
- delete queues on cluster down
- disable process per replica and workers per process workflows
- environment variable to indicate which python file to run

status scenarios:
- request enqueuing has been completed by operator and pods are being initialized?
- what happens if there isn't enough room for all of the pods to run?
- one of the pod fails
- all of the pods fails (items still in queue)
